# Predicting-Recidivism-Rates
This work is designed to support entities offering services to formerly incarcerated individuals. The dataset consists of individuals currently incarcerated in the Texas Prison System.

It was important for me to have an opportunity to dive into each part of the data science workflow as thoroughly as possible. I wanted to gain experience in all aspects of the work, and sought out a problem that would offer challenges along each step. I found it in this work.


### Problem Statement:
Is an inmate's initial crime and their age at the time it was committed predictive of recidivism?

### Goal:
To create a model that predicts the likelihood of recidivism for an inmate in an attempt to support the efforts of any entity providing services for previously incarcerated individuals.

# Research
I began this project by looking into available government datasets. I also found Probublica's work exposing racial bias in the COMPAS algorithm (kaggle and research/explanatory articles). This allowed me to gain access to their process,  their notebooks of work, and their datasets.

From here I considered what data I might want, and I started looking into the Huntsville State Penitentiary.
